The shape, size, and even color of its leaves transform to match those of plants in its proximity without even needing to physically contact them&mdash;a behavior not known in any other plant! It graciously offers its edible berries to humans and other animals.'

This vine has created an alternative to the Wood Wide Web allowing plants to communicate with each other through the connections this plant makes&mdash;even between species! Plants are able to send warning signals to others in case of pests or other dangers. In addition, genetic analysis has also found it borrows a lot of its DNA from plants it parasitizes.",
